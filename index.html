                <p>Nice to meet you! I'm Sam. I currently live on the West Side of Cleveland and work in Cleveland
                    midtown. I hold a Master's in Professional & Technical communication, and it has afforded me the
                    ability to be intensely detail-oriented while never losing sight of the big picture. I'm currently
                    enrolled in a coding class at Case Western Reserve University and am excited to expand these skills
                    and take them in a new, forward-looking direction. I am fastidious and hold myself to rigorous
                    standards in not only providing quality work, but work that maintains a sense of humanity. I've
                    found that material with authentic personality isn't something easy to come by. I value a
                    respectful honesty in what can and can't be done, and am always looking for ways to finagle a
                    solution despite the obstacles.</p>

                    Avocationally, I love music. I'm either combing the internet for new music, writing songs, or
                    trying to figure out how to play a song. I always appreciate the solitude and perspective that a
                    hike can provide. I'm a lifelong Browns fan. Hopefully that demonstrates some tenacity, if not some
                    blind optimism. But it's all about striking a balance, isn't it?</p>
